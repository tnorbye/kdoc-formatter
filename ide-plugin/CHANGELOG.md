# KDoc Formatter Plugin Changelog

## [1.4.0]

- The KDoc formatter now participates in regular IDE source
  code formatting (e.g. Code > Reformat Code). This can be
  turned off via a setting.
- The markup conversion (if enabled) now converts {@link} and {@linkplain}
  tags to the KDoc equivalent.
- Fix bug where preformatted text immediately following a TODO
  comment would be joined into the TODO.

## [1.3.3]

- Don't break lines inside link text which will
  include the comment asterisk
- Allow formatting during indexing

## [1.3.2]

- Bugfixes and update deprecated API usage for 2021.2
  compatibility

## [1.3.1]

- Fixes a few bugs around markup conversion not producing the right
  number of blank lines for a <p>, and adds a few more prefixes
  as non-breakable (e.g. if you have an em dash in your sentence --
  like this -- we don't want the "--" to be placed at the beginning of
  a line.)
- Adds an --add-punctuation command line flag and IDE setting to
  optionally add closing periods on capitalized paragraphs at the end
  of the comment.
- Special cases TODO: comments (placing them in a block by themselves
  and using hanging indents).

## [1.3.0]

- Many improves to the markdown handling, such as quoted blocks,
  headers, list continuations, etc.
- Markup conversion, which until this point could convert inline tags
  such as **bold** into **bold**, etc, now handles
  many block level tags too, such as \<p>, \<h1>, etc.
- The IDE plugin can now also reformat line comments under the caret.
  (This is opt-in via options.)

## [1.2.0]

- IDE settings panel
- Ability to alternate formatting between greedy and optimal line
  breaking when invoked repeatedly (and for short comments,
  alternating between single line and multiple lines.)

## [1.1.2]

- Basic support for <code>.editorconfig</code> files.

## [1.1.0]

- Support for setting maximum comment width (capped by the maximum line width).

## [1.0.0]

- Initial version
