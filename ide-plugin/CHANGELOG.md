# KDoc Formatter Plugin Changelog

## [1.6.6]
- Add support for 2025.1 EAP, and migrate to 2.x version of IntelliJ gradle plugin.
- Fix https://github.com/tnorbye/kdoc-formatter/issues/106
- Allow line comment block reformatting to work at the end of lines

## [1.6.5]
- Mark plugin as compatible with 2024.3.

## [1.6.4]
- Switch continuation indent from 4 to 3. (IntelliJ's Dokka preview
  treats an indent of 4 or more as preformatted text even on a continued
  line; Dokka itself (and Markdown) does not.
- Add ability to override the continuation indent in the IDE plugin
  settings.
- Don't reorder `@sample` tags (backported
  https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt/issues/406)

## [1.6.3]
- Compatibility with IntelliJ 2024.2 EAP
- Mark plugin as compatible with K2

## [1.6.2]
- Compatibility with IntelliJ 2024.1 EAP.

## [1.6.1]
- Compatibility with IntelliJ 2023.3 EAP.

## [1.6.0]
- Updated dependencies and fixed a few minor bugs, including
  https://github.com/tnorbye/kdoc-formatter/issues/88 as well as issue
  398 in ktfmt.

## [1.5.9]
- Compatibility with IntelliJ 2023.1

## [1.5.8]
- Fixed a number of bugs:
   - #84: Line overrun when using closed-open interval notation
   - More gracefully handle unterminated [] references (for example when
     comment is using it in things like [closed, open) intervals)
   - Recognize and convert accidentally capitalized kdoc tags like @See
   - If you have a [ref] which spans a line such that the # ends up as a
     new line, don't treat this as a "# heading".
   - If you're using optimal line breaking and there's a really long,
     unbreakable word in the paragraph, switch that paragraph over to
     greedy line breaking (to make the paragraph better balanced since
     the really long word throws the algorithm off.)
   - Fix a few scenarios where markup conversion from <p> and </p>
     wasn't converting everything.
   - Allow @property[name], not just @param[name]
- Some minor code cleanup.

## [1.5.7]
- Fixed the following bugs:
      - #76: Preserve newline style (CRLF on Windows)
      - #77: Preformatting error
      - #78: Preformatting stability
      - #79: Replace `{@param name}` with `[name]`

## [1.5.6]
- Bugfix: the override line width setting was not working

## [1.5.5]
- The plugin can now be upgraded without restarting the IDE
- Improved support for .editorconfig files; these settings will now be
  reflected immediately (in prior versions you had to restart the IDE
  because they were improperly cached)
- Fixed a copy/paste bug which prevented the "Collapse short comments
  that fit on a single line" option from working.
- Several formatting related improvements (fixes for
  bugs #53, #69, #70, #71, #72)

## [1.5.4]
- Fix 9 bugs filed by the ktfmt project.

## [1.5.3]
- @param tags are reordered to match the parameter order in the
  corresponding method signature.
- There are now options for explicitly specifying the line width and the
  comment width which overrides the inferred width from code styles or
  .editorconfig files.
- Some reorganization of the options along with updates labels to
  clarify what they mean.

## [1.5.2]
- Adds a new option which lets you turn off the concept of a separate
  maximum comment width from the maximum line width. By default,
  comments are limited to 72 characters wide (or more accurately the
  configured width for Markdown files), which leads to more readable
  text. However, if you really want the full line width to be used,
  uncheck the "Allow max comment width to be separate from line width"
  setting.
- Fixes bug to ensure the line width and max comment width are properly
  read from the IDE environment settings.

## [1.5.1]
- Updated formatter with many bug fixes, as well as improved support for
  formatting tables as well as reordering KDoc tags. There are new
  options controlling both of these behaviors.
- Removed Kotlin logo from the IDE plugin icon

## [1.4.1]
- Fix formatting nested bulleted lists
  (https://github.com/tnorbye/kdoc-formatter/issues/36)

## [1.4.0]
- The KDoc formatter now participates in regular IDE source code
  formatting (e.g. Code > Reformat Code). This can be turned off via a
  setting.
- The markup conversion (if enabled) now converts [] and {@linkplain}
  tags to the KDoc equivalent.
- Fix bug where preformatted text immediately following a TODO comment
  would be joined into the TODO.

## [1.3.3]
- Don't break lines inside link text which will include the comment
  asterisk
- Allow formatting during indexing

## [1.3.2]
- Bugfixes and update deprecated API usage for 2021.2 compatibility

## [1.3.1]
- Fixes a few bugs around markup conversion not producing the right
  number of blank lines for a <p>, and adds a few more prefixes as
  non-breakable (e.g. if you have an em dash in your sentence -- like
  this -- we don't want the "--" to be placed at the beginning of a
  line.)
- Adds an --add-punctuation command line flag and IDE setting to
  optionally add closing periods on capitalized paragraphs at the end of
  the comment.
- Special cases TODO: comments (placing them in a block by themselves
  and using hanging indents).

## [1.3.0]
- Many improves to the markdown handling, such as quoted blocks,
  headers, list continuations, etc.
- Markup conversion, which until this point could convert inline tags
  such as **bold** into **bold**, etc, now handles many block level tags
  too, such as \<p>, \<h1>, etc.
- The IDE plugin can now also reformat line comments under the caret.
  (This is opt-in via options.)

## [1.2.0]
- IDE settings panel
- Ability to alternate formatting between greedy and optimal line
  breaking when invoked repeatedly (and for short comments, alternating
  between single line and multiple lines.)

## [1.1.2]
- Basic support for <code>.editorconfig</code> files.

## [1.1.0]
- Support for setting maximum comment width (capped by the maximum line
  width).

## [1.0.0]
- Initial version
