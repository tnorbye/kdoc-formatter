             * and things like field initializers. PSI continues to be used at the outer
             * level: for packages, classes, and methods (declarations and signatures).
             * There are also wrappers around some of these for convenience.
             * <p>
             * The {@linkplain SourceCodeScanner} interface reflects this fact. For example,
             * when you indicate that you want to check calls to a method named {@code foo},
             * the call site node is a UAST node (in this case, {@link UCallExpression},
             * but the called method itself is a {@link PsiMethod}, since that method
             * might be anywhere (including in a library that we don't have source for,
             * so UAST doesn't make sense.)
             * <p>
             * <h2>Migrating JavaPsiScanner to SourceCodeScanner</h2>
             * As described above, PSI is still used, so a lot of code will remain the
             * same. For example, all resolve methods, including those in UAST, will
             * continue to return PsiElement, not necessarily a UElement. For example,
             * if you resolve a method call or field reference, you'll get a
             * {@link PsiMethod} or {@link PsiField} back.
             * <p>
             * However, the visitor methods have all changed, generally to change
             * to UAST types. For example, the signature
             * {@link JavaPsiScanner#visitMethodCall(JavaContext, JavaElementVisitor, PsiMethodCallExpression, PsiMethod)}
             * should be changed to {@link SourceCodeScanner#visitMethodCall(JavaContext, UCallExpression, PsiMethod)}.
             * <p>
             * Similarly, replace {@link JavaPsiScanner#createPsiVisitor} with {@link SourceCodeScanner#createUastHandler},
             * {@link JavaPsiScanner#getApplicablePsiTypes()} with {@link SourceCodeScanner#getApplicableUastTypes()}, etc.
             * <p>
             * There are a bunch of new methods on classes like {@link JavaContext} which lets
             * you pass in a {@link UElement} to match the existing {@link PsiElement} methods.
             * <p>
             * If you have code which does something specific with PSI classes,
             * the following mapping table in alphabetical order might be helpful, since it lists the
             * corresponding UAST classes.

             * Note however that UAST isn't just a "renaming of classes"; there are
             * some changes to the structure of the AST as well. Particularly around
             * calls.
             *
             * <h3>Parents</h3>
             * In UAST, you get your parent {@linkplain UElement} by calling
             * {@code getUastParent} instead of {@code getParent}. This is to avoid
             * method name clashes on some elements which are both UAST elements
             * and PSI elements at the same time - such as {@link UMethod}.
             * <h3>Children</h3>
             * When you're going in the opposite direction (e.g. you have a {@linkplain PsiMethod}
             * and you want to look at its content, you should <b>not</b> use
             * {@link PsiMethod#getBody()}. This will only give you the PSI child content,
             * which won't work for example when dealing with Kotlin methods.
             * Normally lint passes you the {@linkplain UMethod} which you should be procesing
             * instead. But if for some reason you need to look up the UAST method
             * body from a {@linkplain PsiMethod}, use this:
             * <pre>
             *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
             *     UExpression body = context.getMethodBody(method);
             * </pre>
             * Similarly if you have a {@link PsiField} and you want to look up its field
             * initializer, use this:
             * <pre>
             *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
             *     UExpression initializer = context.getInitializerBody(field);
             * </pre>
             *
             * <h3>Call names</h3>
             * In PSI, a call was represented by a PsiCallExpression, and to get to things
             * like the method called or to the operand/qualifier, you'd first need to get
             * the "method expression". In UAST there is no method expression and this
             * information is available directly on the {@linkplain UCallExpression} element.
             * Therefore, here's how you'd change the code:
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getReferenceName();
             * ---
             * &gt;    call.getMethodName()
             * </pre>
             * <h3>Call qualifiers</h3>
             * Similarly,
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getQualifierExpression();
             * ---
             * &gt;    call.getReceiver()
             * </pre>
             * <h3>Call arguments</h3>
             * PSI had a separate PsiArgumentList element you had to look up before you could
             * get to the actual arguments, as an array. In UAST these are available directly on
             * the call, and are represented as a list instead of an array.
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    PsiExpression[] args = call.getArgumentList().getExpressions();
             * ---
             * &gt;    List<UExpression> args = call.getValueArguments();
             * </pre>
             * Typically you also need to go through your code and replace array access,
             * arg\[i], with list access, {@code arg.get(i)}. Or in Kotlin, just arg\[i]...
             *
             * <h3>Instanceof</h3>
             * You may have code which does something like "parent instanceof PsiAssignmentExpression"
             * to see if something is an assignment. Instead, use one of the many utilities
             * in {@link UastExpressionUtils} - such as {@link UastExpressionUtils#isAssignment(UElement)}.
             * Take a look at all the methods there now - there are methods for checking whether
             * a call is a constructor, whether an expression is an array initializer, etc etc.
             *
             * <h3>Android Resources</h3>
             * Don't do your own AST lookup to figure out if something is a reference to
             * an Android resource (e.g. see if the class refers to an inner class of a class
             * named "R" etc.)  There is now a new utility class which handles this:
             * {@link ResourceReference}. Here's an example of code which has a {@link UExpression}
             * and wants to know it's referencing a R.styleable resource:
             * <pre>
             *        ResourceReference reference = ResourceReference.get(expression);
             *        if (reference == null || reference.getType() != ResourceType.STYLEABLE) {
             *            return;
             *        }
             *        ...
             * </pre>
             *
             * <h3>Binary Expressions</h3>
             * If you had been using {@link PsiBinaryExpression} for things like checking comparator
             * operators or arithmetic combination of operands, you can replace this with
             * {@link UBinaryExpression}. <b>But you normally shouldn't; you should use
             * {@link UPolyadicExpression} instead</b>. A polyadic expression is just like a binary
             * expression, but possibly with more than two terms. With the old parser backend,
             * an expression like "A + B + C" would be represented by nested binary expressions
             * (first A + B, then a parent element which combined that binary expression with C).
             * However, this will now be provided as a {@link UPolyadicExpression} instead. And
             * the binary case is handled trivially without the need to special case it.
             * <h3>Method name changes</h3>
             * The following table maps some common method names and what their corresponding
             * names are in UAST.

             * <h3>Handlers versus visitors</h3>
             * If you are processing a method on your own, or even a full class, you should switch
             * from JavaRecursiveElementVisitor to AbstractUastVisitor.
             * However, most lint checks don't do their own full AST traversal; they instead
             * participate in a shared traversal of the tree, registering element types they're
             * interested with using {@link #getApplicableUastTypes()} and then providing
             * a visitor where they implement the corresponding visit methods. However, from
             * these visitors you should <b>not</b> be calling super.visitX. To remove this
             * whole confusion, lint now provides a separate class, {@link UElementHandler}.
             * For the shared traversal, just provide this handler instead and implement the
             * appropriate visit methods. It will throw an error if you register element types
             * in {@linkplain #getApplicableUastTypes()} that you don't override.
             *
             * <p>
             * <h3>Migrating JavaScanner to SourceCodeScanner</h3>
             * First read the javadoc on how to convert from the older {@linkplain JavaScanner}
             * interface over to {@linkplain JavaPsiScanner}. While {@linkplain JavaPsiScanner} is itself
             * deprecated, it's a lot closer to {@link SourceCodeScanner} so a lot of the same concepts
             * apply; then follow the above section.

             * files, such as Kotlin files.)
             *
             * There are several different common patterns for detecting issues:
             * <ul>
             * <li> Checking calls to a given method. For this see [getApplicableMethodNames] and [visitMethodCall]</li>

             * <li> Extending a given class or implementing a given interface. For this, see [applicableSuperClasses] and
             *     [visitClass]</li>
             * <li> More complicated scenarios: perform a general AST traversal with a visitor. In this case, first tell lint
             *     which AST node types you're interested in with the [getApplicableUastTypes] method, and then
             *     provide a [UElementHandler] from the [createUastHandler] where you override the various applicable
             *     handler methods. This is done rather than a general visitor from the root node to avoid having to
             *     have every single lint detector (there are hundreds) do a full tree traversal on its own.</li>
             * </ul>
             * [SourceCodeScanner] exposes the UAST API to lint checks. UAST is short for "Universal AST" and is an abstract
             * syntax tree library which abstracts away details about Java versus Kotlin versus other similar languages and lets
             * the client of the library access the AST in a unified way.
             *
             * UAST isn't actually a full replacement for PSI; it **augments** PSI. Essentially, UAST is used for the **inside**
             * of methods (e.g. method bodies), and things like field initializers. PSI continues to be used at the outer level:
             * for packages, classes, and methods (declarations and signatures). There are also wrappers around some of these
             * for convenience.
             *
             * The [SourceCodeScanner] interface reflects this fact. For example, when you indicate that you want to check calls
             * to a method named {@code foo}, the call site node is a UAST node (in this case, [UCallExpression], but the called
             * method itself is a [PsiMethod], since that method might be anywhere (including in a library that we don't have
             * source for, so UAST doesn't make sense.)
             *
             * ## Migrating JavaPsiScanner to SourceCodeScanner
             * As described above, PSI is still used, so a lot of code will remain the same. For example, all resolve methods,
             * including those in UAST, will continue to return PsiElement, not necessarily a UElement. For example, if you
             * resolve a method call or field reference, you'll get a [PsiMethod] or [PsiField] back.
             *
             * However, the visitor methods have all changed, generally to change to UAST types. For example, the signature
             * [JavaPsiScanner.visitMethodCall] should be changed to [SourceCodeScanner.visitMethodCall].
             *
             * Similarly, replace [JavaPsiScanner.createPsiVisitor] with [SourceCodeScanner.createUastHandler],
             * [JavaPsiScanner.getApplicablePsiTypes] with [SourceCodeScanner.getApplicableUastTypes], etc.
             *
             * There are a bunch of new methods on classes like [JavaContext] which lets you pass in a [UElement] to match the
             * existing [PsiElement] methods.
             *
             * If you have code which does something specific with PSI classes, the following mapping table in alphabetical
             * order might be helpful, since it lists the corresponding UAST classes.

             *
             * Note however that UAST isn't just a "renaming of classes"; there are some changes to the structure of the AST as
             * well. Particularly around calls.
             *
             * ### Parents
             * In UAST, you get your parent [UElement] by calling {@code getUastParent} instead of {@code getParent}. This is to
             * avoid method name clashes on some elements which are both UAST elements and PSI elements at the same time - such
             * as [UMethod].
             *
             * ### Children
             * When you're going in the opposite direction (e.g. you have a [PsiMethod] and you want to look at its content,
             * you should **not** use [PsiMethod.getBody]. This will only give you the PSI child content, which won't work
             * for example when dealing with Kotlin methods. Normally lint passes you the [UMethod] which you should be
             * procesing instead. But if for some reason you need to look up the UAST method body from a [PsiMethod], use this:
             * <pre>
             *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
             *     UExpression body = context.getMethodBody(method);
             * </pre>
             * Similarly if you have a [PsiField] and you want to look up its field initializer, use this:
             * <pre>
             *     UastContext context = UastUtils.getUastContext(element);
             *     UExpression initializer = context.getInitializerBody(field);
             * </pre>
             *
             * ### Call names
             * In PSI, a call was represented by a PsiCallExpression, and to get to things like the method called or to the
             * operand/qualifier, you'd first need to get the "method expression". In UAST there is no method expression and
             * this information is available directly on the [UCallExpression] element. Therefore, here's how you'd change the
             * code:
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getReferenceName();
             * ---
             * &gt;    call.getMethodName()
             * </pre>
             *
             * ### Call qualifiers
             * Similarly,
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    call.getMethodExpression().getQualifierExpression();
             * ---
             * &gt;    call.getReceiver()
             * </pre>
             *
             * ### Call arguments
             * PSI had a separate PsiArgumentList element you had to look up before you could get to the actual arguments, as an
             * array. In UAST these are available directly on the call, and are represented as a list instead of an array.
             * <pre>
             * &lt;    PsiExpression[] args = call.getArgumentList().getExpressions();
             * ---
             * &gt;    List<UExpression> args = call.getValueArguments();
             * </pre>
             * Typically you also need to go through your code and replace array access, arg\[i], with list access, {@code
             * arg.get(i)}. Or in Kotlin, just arg\[i]...
             *
             * ### Instanceof
             * You may have code which does something like "parent instanceof PsiAssignmentExpression" to see if
             * something is an assignment. Instead, use one of the many utilities in [UastExpressionUtils] - such as
             * [UastExpressionUtils.isAssignment]. Take a look at all the methods there now - there are methods for checking
             * whether a call is a constructor, whether an expression is an array initializer, etc etc.
             *
             * ### Android Resources
             * Don't do your own AST lookup to figure out if something is a reference to an Android resource (e.g. see if the
             * class refers to an inner class of a class named "R" etc.) There is now a new utility class which handles this:
             * [ResourceReference]. Here's an example of code which has a [UExpression] and wants to know it's referencing a
             * R.styleable resource:
             * <pre>
             *        ResourceReference reference = ResourceReference.get(expression);
             *        if (reference == null || reference.getType() != ResourceType.STYLEABLE) {
             *            return;
             *        }
             *        ...
             * </pre>
             *
             * ### Binary Expressions
             * If you had been using [PsiBinaryExpression] for things like checking comparator operators or arithmetic
             * combination of operands, you can replace this with [UBinaryExpression]. **But you normally shouldn't; you should
             * use [UPolyadicExpression] instead**. A polyadic expression is just like a binary expression, but possibly with
             * more than two terms. With the old parser backend, an expression like "A + B + C" would be represented by nested
             * binary expressions (first A + B, then a parent element which combined that binary expression with C). However,
             * this will now be provided as a [UPolyadicExpression] instead. And the binary case is handled trivially without
             * the need to special case it.
             *
             * ### Method name changes
             * The following table maps some common method names and what their corresponding names are in UAST.
             * <table>
             *

             * </table>
             *
             * ### Handlers versus visitors
             * If you are processing a method on your own, or even a full class, you should switch from
             * JavaRecursiveElementVisitor to AbstractUastVisitor. However, most lint checks don't do their own full AST
             * traversal; they instead participate in a shared traversal of the tree, registering element types they're
             * interested with using [getApplicableUastTypes] and then providing a visitor where they implement the
             * corresponding visit methods. However, from these visitors you should **not** be calling super.visitX. To remove
             * this whole confusion, lint now provides a separate class, [UElementHandler]. For the shared traversal, just
             * provide this handler instead and implement the appropriate visit methods. It will throw an error if you register
             * element types in [getApplicableUastTypes] that you don't override.
             *
             * ### Migrating JavaScanner to SourceCodeScanner
             * First read the javadoc on how to convert from the older [JavaScanner] interface over to [JavaPsiScanner]. While
             * [JavaPsiScanner] is itself deprecated, it's a lot closer to [SourceCodeScanner] so a lot of the same concepts
             * apply; then follow the above section.
